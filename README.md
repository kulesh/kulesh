### Recursive LM
**Can an agent runtime grow software through use?** A combination of recursive agents and language model backed dynamic dispatch to push the envelope on software creation through use.

- [Recurgent](https://github.com/kulesh/recurgent) - Write code/spec in your own domain language and let the agent iterate on actual implementation.

### Programmable enterprises

**Effective organizations encode how they operate in software and build products that build products.** When AI assistants augment every employee, organizations can learn faster, share context more effectively, and improve continuously.

### Generative specifications as a distribution medium

**Exploring how AI changes software as a medium rather than as a tool.**  Software has been one of the most effective change agents of the past four decades. AI is now reshaping how software itself is created. I’m exploring generative specifications as a new medium of distribution, where behavior, constraints, and evolution are encoded declaratively rather than imperatively.

- [Waypoints](https://github.com/kulesh/waypoints/) - More recent work on genspec

## I write to think.

Writing is how I crystallize ideas, test assumptions, and make implicit mental models explicit. I don't publish everything I write. Here are some recently published pieces:
