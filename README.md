Hi there,

I’m Kulesh, a builder, software engineer, and CTO. I spend most of my time building products, designing the systems behind them, and pressure-testing both against real-world constraints.

**I’m interested in how AI changes software as a medium rather than as a tool.** Instead of using AI to make existing development workflows more efficient, I focus on how AI can generate software just in time from distributed specifications.

This shift changes the software engineering lifecycle, the necessary tooling, and the role of the software engineer.

My work explores this shift by building concrete systems that test new assumptions about specification, generation, and evolution.

## Some ongoing explorations:

### Generative specifications as a distribution medium

Software has been one of the most effective change agents of the past four decades. AI is now reshaping how software itself is created. I’m exploring generative specifications as a new medium of distribution, where behavior, constraints, and evolution are encoded declaratively rather than imperatively.

Waypoints is a prototype system that generates and evolves software on demand from distributed specifications, rather than treating code as the primary artifact.

### Programmable enterprises

Effective organizations encode how they operate in software and build products that build products. When AI assistants augment every employee, organizations can learn faster, share context more effectively, and improve continuously.

Catsyphon and AIObscura explore how we can learn from artifacts generated by AI Assistants (logs, plans, etc.) and improve learning across teams.

### dotfiles

This repository captures the evolving toolchain I use daily, shaped by real constraints and constant iteration.

## I write to think.

Writing is how I crystallize ideas, test assumptions, and make implicit models explicit. I don't publish everything I write. Here are some recently published pieces:
